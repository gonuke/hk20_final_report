	abstract = {Testing blanket concepts in the integrated fusion environment is one of the principal objectives of ITER. Blanket test modules will be inserted in ITER from Day 1 of its operation and will provide the first experimental data on the feasibility of the D-T cycle for fusion. With the US rejoining ITER, the US community has decided to have strong participation in the ITER Test Blanket Module (TBM) Program. A US strategy for ITER-TBM has evolved that emphasizes international collaboration. A study was initiated to select the two blanket options for the US ITER-TBM in light of new R\&D results from the US and world programs over the past decade. The study is led by the Plasma Chamber community in partnership with the Materials, PFC, Safety, and physics communities. The study focuses on assessment of the critical feasibility issues for candidate blanket concepts and it is strongly coupled to R\&D of modeling and experiments. Examples of issues are MHD insulators, SiC insert viability and compatibility with PbLi, tritium permeation, MHD effects on heat transfer, solid breeder “temperature window” and thermomechanics, and chemistry control of molten salts. A dual coolant liquid breeder and a helium-cooled solid breeder blanket concept have been selected for the US ITER-TBM.},

	abstract = {This study, called APEX, is exploring novel concepts for fusion chamber technology that can substantially improve the attractiveness of fusion energy systems. The emphasis of the study is on fundamental understanding and advancing the underlying engineering sciences, integration of the physics and engineering requirements, and enhancing innovation for the chamber technology components surrounding the plasma. The chamber technology goals in APEX include: (1) high power density capability with neutron wall load {\textgreater}10 MW/m2 and surface heat flux {\textgreater}2 MW/m2, (2) high power conversion efficiency ({\textgreater}40\%), (3) high availability, and (4) simple technological and material constraints. Two classes of innovative concepts have emerged that offer great promise and deserve further research and development. The first class seeks to eliminate the solid “bare” first wall by flowing liquids facing the plasma. This liquid wall idea evolved during the APEX study into a number of concepts based on: (a) using liquid metals (Li or Sn–Li) or a molten salt (Flibe) as the working liquid, (b) utilizing electromagnetic, inertial and/or other types of forces to restrain the liquid against a backing wall and control the hydrodynamic flow configurations, and (c) employing a thin (∼2 cm) or thick (∼40 cm) liquid layer to remove the surface heat flux and attenuate the neutrons. These liquid wall concepts have some common features but also have widely different issues and merits. Some of the attractive features of liquid walls include the potential for: (1) high power density capability; (2) higher plasma β and stable physics regimes if liquid metals are used; (3) increased disruption survivability; (4) reduced volume of radioactive waste; (5) reduced radiation damage in structural materials; and (6) higher availability. Analyses show that not all of these potential advantages may be realized simultaneously in a single concept. However, the realization of only a subset of these advantages will result in remarkable progress toward attractive fusion energy systems. Of the many scientific and engineering issues for liquid walls, the most important are: (1) plasma–liquid interactions including both plasma–liquid surface and liquid wall–bulk plasma interactions; (2) hydrodynamic flow configuration control in complex geometries including penetrations; and (3) heat transfer at free surface and temperature control. The second class of concepts focuses on ideas for extending the capabilities, particularly the power density and operating temperature limits, of solid first walls. The most promising idea, called EVOLVE, is based on the use of a high-temperature refractory alloy (e.g. W–5\% Re) with an innovative cooling scheme based on the use of the heat of vaporization of lithium. Calculations show that an evaporative system with Li at ∼1 200°C can remove the goal heat loads and result in a high power conversion efficiency. The vapor operating pressure is low, resulting in a very low operating stress in the structure. In addition, the lithium flow rate is about a factor of ten lower than that required for traditional self-cooled first wall/blanket concepts. Therefore, insulator coatings are not required. Key issues for EVOLVE include: (1) two-phase heat transfer and transport including MHD effects; (2) feasibility of fabricating entire blanket segments of W alloys; and (3) the effect of neutron irradiation on W.},

	abstract = {Detailed radiation transport calculations are necessary for many aspects of the design of fusion
energy systems (FES) such as ensuring occupational safety, assessing the activation of system components
for waste disposal, and maintaining cryogenic temperatures within superconducting magnets. Hybrid
Monte Carlo (MC)/deterministic techniques are necessary for this analysis because FES are large, heavily
shielded, and contain streaming paths that can only be resolved with MC. The tremendous complexity of
FES necessitates the use of CAD geometry for design and analysis. Previous ITER analysis has required
the translation of CAD geometry to MCNP5 form in order to use the AutomateD VAriaNce reducTion
Generator (ADVANTG) for hybrid MC/deterministic transport. In this work, ADVANTG was modified
to support CAD geometry, allowing hybrid (MC)/deterministic transport to be done automatically and
eliminating the need for this translation step. This was done by adding a new ray tracing routine
to ADVANTG for CAD geometries using the Direct Accelerated Geometry Monte Carlo (DAGMC)
software library. This new capability is demonstrated with a prompt dose rate calculation for an ITER
computational benchmark problem using both the Consistent Adjoint Driven Importance Sampling
(CADIS) method an the Forward Weighted (FW)-CADIS method. The variance reduction parameters
produced by ADVANTG are shown to be the same using CAD geometry and standard MCNP5 geometry.
Significant speedups were observed for both neutrons (as high as a factor of 7.1) and photons (as high as
a factor of 59.6).},

	abstract = {In fusion energy systems (FES) high-energy neutrons born from burning plasma activate system components to form radionuclides. The biological dose rate that results from photons emitted by these radionuclides after shutdown—the shutdown dose rate (SDR)—must be quantified for maintenance planning. This can be done using the Rigorous Two-Step (R2S) method, which involves separate neutron and photon transport calculations, coupled by a nuclear inventory analysis code. The geometric complexity and highly attenuating configuration of FES motivates the use of CAD geometry and advanced variance
reduction for this analysis.

An R2S workflow has been created with the new capability of performing SDR analysis directly from CAD geometry with Cartesian or tetrahedral meshes and with biased photon source sampling, enabling
the use of the Consistent Adjoint Driven Importance Sampling (CADIS) variance reduction technique. This workflow has been validated with the Frascati Neutron Generator (FNG)-ITER SDR benchmark using both Cartesian and tetrahedral meshes and both unbiased and biased photon source sampling. All results are
within 20.4\% of experimental values, which constitutes satisfactory agreement. Photon transport using
CADIS is demonstrated to yield speedups as high as 8.5·10{\textasciicircum}5 for problems using the FNG geometry.},

(SDR) is calculated by coupling neutron transport, activation analysis, and photon transport. The size, complexity, and attenuating configuration of FES motivate the use of hybrid Monte Carlo (MC)/deterministic
neutron transport. The Multi-Step Consistent Adjoint Driven Importance Sampling (MS-CADIS) method can be used to optimize MC neutron transport for coupled multiphysics problems, including SDR analysis, using
deterministic estimates of adjoint flux distributions. When used for SDR analysis, MS-CADIS requires the formulation of an adjoint neutron source that approximates the transmutation process. In this work, transmutation approximations are used to derive a solution for this adjoint neutron source. It is shown that these approximations are reasonably met for typical FES neutron spectra and materials over a range of irradiation scenarios. When these approximations are met, the Groupwise Transmutation (GT)-CADIS method, proposed
here, can be used effectively. GT-CADIS is an implementation of the MS-CADIS method for SDR analysis that uses a series of single-energy-group irradiations to calculate the adjoint neutron source. For a simple SDR
problem, GT-CADIS provides speedups of 200 ± 100 relative to global variance reduction with the Forward Weighted (FW)-CADIS method and 9 ± 5 · 10{\textasciicircum}4 relative to analog.

The photon dose rate after shutdown from the resultant radionuclides must be quantified for maintenance planning. This shutdown dose rate (SDR) is calculated by coupling neutron transport, activation analysis, and photon transport. The size, complexity, and attenuating configuration of FES motivate the use of hybrid Monte Carlo (MC)/deterministic neutron transport. The Multi-Step Consistent Adjoint Driven Importance Sampling (MS-CADIS) method can be used to optimize MC neutron transport for this purpose. This requires the formulation of an adjoint neutron source that approximates the transmutation process. In this work one such formulation is introduced which is valid when a specific set of transmutation criteria are met, referred to as the Single Neutron Interaction and Low Burnup (SNILB) criteria. These criteria are quantitatively evaluated for typical FES scenarios and are shown to be met within a reasonable margin. Groupwise Transmutation (GT)-CADIS, proposed here, is an implementation of MS-CADIS that calculates this adjoint neutron source using a series of irradiation calculations. For a simple SDR problem, GT-CADIS provides speedups of 200 ± 100 relative to global variance reduction with the Forward Weighted (FW)-CADIS method and 90,000 ± 50,000 relative to analog. When the SNILB criteria are egregiously violated, GT-CADIS modifications are proposed and are shown to provide significant performance improvements. Finally, GT-CADIS is applied to a production-level problem involving a Spherical Tokamak Fusion Nuclear Science Facility (ST-FNSF) device. This work shows that GT-CADIS is broadly applicable to FES scenarios and will significantly reduce the computational resources necessary for SDR analysis.},

In this work, DAG-MCNP5–calculated results will be compared to native MCNP5–calculated results and to measured results for ITER-specific benchmark experiments in order to provide additional quality assurance for DAG-MCNP.Calculated results are compared for the bulk shield mock-up and the helium-cooled pebble bed (HCPB) breeder blanket mock-up, which utilize the 14-MeV Frascati Neutron Generator facility. Neutron flux was measured at different depths in these experimental mock-ups using activation foils that cover the neutron energy range of 0 to 14 MeV. Additionally, tritium production in Li2CO3 pellets was measured in the HCPB experiment.Results of the foil activation calculations for the bulk shielding experiment and the HCPB breeder experiment show agreement within statistical uncertainty for DAG-MCNP5 and native MCNP5. Calculated results for tritium production in the HCPB mock-up also agree within statistical uncertainty for the DAG-MCNP5 and native MCNP5 calculations. Timing results showed that DAG-MCNP5 is 5.3 times slower than native MCNP5 for the bulk shield mock-up. For the HCPB mock-up, DAG-MCNP5 is 4.8 times slower than native MCNP5.It is concluded that the close agreement of calculated foil activation and tritium production between DAG-MCNP5 and native MCNP5 in these complex and ITER-relevant geometries provides additional quality assurance for the DAG-MCNP5 code and the mcnp2cad tool used in this work.},

	abstract = {Over the last decade, the role of neutronics modeling has been shifting from analysis of
each component separately to high fidelity, full-scale analysis of the nuclear systems entire
domains. The high accuracy, associated with minimizing modeling approximations and including
more physical and geometric details, is now feasible because of advancements in computing
hardware and development of efficient modeling methods. The hybrid Monte Carlo/deterministic
techniques, CADIS and FW-CADIS dramatically increase the efficiency of neutronics modeling,
but their use in the design of large and geometrically complex nuclear systems is restricted by the
availability of computing resources for their preliminarily deterministic calculations and the
large computer memory requirements of their final Monte Carlo calculations.
To reduce the computational time and memory requirements of the hybrid Monte
Carlo/deterministic techniques while maintaining their efficiency improvements, three automatic
mesh adaptivity algorithms were developed and added to the Oak Ridge National Laboratory
AutomateD VAriaNce reducTion Generator (ADVANTG) code. First, a mixed-material
approach, which we refer to as the macromaterial approach, enhances the fidelity of the
deterministic models without having to refine the mesh of the deterministic calculations. Second,
a deterministic mesh refinement algorithm improves the accuracy of structured mesh
deterministic calculations by capturing as much geometric detail as possible without exceeding
the total number of mesh elements that is usually determined by the availability of computing
resources. Finally, a weight window coarsening algorithm decouples the weight window mesh
from the mesh of the deterministic calculations to remove the memory constraint of the weight
window map from the deterministic mesh resolution.

To analyze the combined effect of the three algorithms developed in this thesis, they were
used to calculate the prompt dose rate throughout the entire ITER experimental facility. This
calculation represents a very challenging shielding problem because of the immense size and
complexity of the ITER structure and the presence of a two meter thick biological shield.
Compared to a FW-CADIS calculation with the same storage size of the variance reduction
parameters, the use of the three algorithms resulted in a 23.3\% increase in the regions where the
dose rate results are achieved in a 10 day Monte Carlo calculation and increased the efficiency of
the Monte Carlo simulation by a factor of 3.4. Because of this significant increase in the Monte
Carlo efficiency which was not accompanied by an increase in the memory requirements, the use
of the three algorithms in FW-CADIS simulations enabled the simulation of this difficult
shielding problem on a regular computer cluster using parallel processing of Monte Carlo
calculations. The results of the parallel Monte Carlo calculation agreed at four points with a very
fine mesh deterministic calculation that was performed on the super-computer, Jaguar.},

	abstract = {Because the superconductivity of the ITER toroidal field coils (TFC) must be protected against local overheating, detailed spatial distribution of the TFC nuclear heating is needed to assess the acceptability of the designs of the blanket, vacuum vessel (VV), and VV thermal shield. Accurate Monte Carlo calculations of the distributions of the TFC nuclear heating are challenged by the small volumes of the tally segmentations and by the thick layers of shielding provided by the blanket and VV. To speed up the MCNP calculation of the nuclear heating distribution in different segments of the coil casing, ground insulation, and winding packs of the ITER TFC, the ITER Organization (IO) used the MCNP weight window generator (WWG). The maximum relative uncertainty of the tallies in this calculation was 82.7\%. In this work, this MCNP calculation was repeated using variance reduction parameters generated by the Oak Ridge National Laboratory AutomateD VAriaNce reducTion Generator (ADVANTG) code and both MCNP calculations were compared in terms of computational efficiency and reliability. Even though the ADVANTG MCNP calculation used less than one-sixth of the computational resources of the IO calculation, the relative uncertainties of all the tallies in the ADVANTG MCNP calculation were less than 6.1\%. The nuclear heating results of the two calculations were significantly different by factors between 1.5 and 2.3 in some of the segments of the furthest winding pack turn from the plasma neutron source. Even though the nuclear heating in this turn may not affect the ITER design because it is much smaller than the nuclear heating in the turns that are closer to the plasma source, it is our recommendation to adopt the utilization of ADVANTG in similar calculations to increase the reliability of MCNP calculations of detailed distributions of nuclear responses.},

A reasonable range of boiling temperatures of this alkali metal is 1200–1400°C, corresponding with a saturation pressure of 0.035–0.2 MPa. Calculations indicate that an evaporative system with Li at ≃1200°C can remove a first wall surface heat flux of {\textgreater}2 MW m−2 with an accompanying neutron wall load of {\textgreater}10 MW m−2.

Structured mesh-based discretization of these problems allows for improved modeling in these activation analysis problems. Finer discretization of these problems results in large computational costs, which drives the investigation of more efficient methods. Within an ad hoc subroutine of the Monte Carlo transport code MCNP, we implement sampling of voxels and photon energies for volumetric sources using the alias method. The alias method enables efficient sampling of a discrete probability distribution, and operates in O(1) time, whereas the simpler direct discrete method requires O(log(n)) time. By using the alias method, voxel sampling becomes a viable alternative to sampling space with the O(1) approach of uniformly sampling the problem volume. Additionally, with voxel sampling it is straightforward to introduce biasing of volumetric sources,
and we implement this biasing of voxels as an additional variance reduction technique that can be applied. We verify our implementation and compare the alias method, with and without biasing, to direct discrete sampling of voxels, and to uniform sampling. We study the behavior of source biasing in a second set of tests and find trends between improvements and source shape, material, and material density. Overall, however, the magnitude of improvements from source biasing appears to be limited. Future work will benefit from the implementation of efficient voxel sampling – particularly with conformal unstructured meshes where the uniform sampling approach cannot be applied.},

	abstract = {This research focuses on developing mesh-based techniques for sampling distributed,
 volumetric sources in Monte Carlo particle transport codes, such as MCNP. This work
 culminated in several source sampling techniques being implemented within a 3-D neutron
 activation workflow.

The most significant development is the implementation of an efficient voxel sampling
 technique. Voxel sampling can be applied to source meshes with any number of mesh
 elements thanks to efficient sampling via the alias method, and meshing of non-source volumes
 can be avoided. Voxel sampling in turn enables straight-forward implementation of source
 biasing for variance reduction, and also the use of unstructured source meshes using
 tetrahedral mesh elements. The uniform sampling technique used in past work is effectively a
 biasing scheme, and thus can be implemented more efficiently with biased voxel sampling.

For this work, the source meshes are inherited from neutron mesh tallies. Cartesian
 structured meshes, which provide straight-forward compatibility with legacy tools can be
 sampled with either the voxel or uniform sampling methods. Alternately, using an unstructured
 mesh (via the unstructured mesh tally capabilities in DAG-MCNP) allows for better conforming
 meshes – particularly with geometries that do not align well with a structured mesh, or where
 the source region is spread out through a region of non-source materials, such as systems of
 pipes.

The set of source sampling techniques is useful as a toolkit for obtaining quality answers
 from a variety of scenarios. This thesis supplements methods development and
 implementation with experiments to identify and understand which sampling techniques
 should be used in different scenarios. The new sampling methods and workflows are shown to
 be in good agreement with results from older methods. While there remain several aspects of
 the new methods’ behavior to characterize, voxel sampling and its derivatives have fully
 replaced older sampling methods in neutron activation analysis work at UW-Madison.},

A peak outboard neutron wall loading of 2 MW/m2 and a fluence of 6 MW-yr/m2 can be achieved with 240 MW fusion power. The tritium breeding ratio is adequate for both blankets. Modest magnet damage parameters were obtained. However, it is recommended that the PF coil in the divertor region be moved vertically farther from the mid-plane to allow adding 15 cm of shield to reduce the peak organic insulator dose to an acceptable level.},

	abstract = {Neutronics assessment has been performed for molten salt breeding blanket design options that can be utilized in fusion power plants. The concepts evaluated are a self-cooled Flinabe blanket with Be multiplier and dual-coolant blankets with He-cooled FW and structure. Three different molten salts were considered including the high melting point Flibe, a low melting point Flibe, and Flinabe. The same TBR can be achieved with a thinner self-cooled blanket compared to the dual-coolant blanket. A thicker Be zone is required in designs with Flinabe. The overall TBR will be 1.07 based on 3-D calculations without breeding in the divertor region. Using Be yields higher blanket energy multiplication than obtainable with Pb. A modest amount of tritium is produced in the Be ( 3 kg) over the blanket lifetime of 3 FPY. Using He gas in the dual-coolant blanket results in about a factor of 2 lower blanket shielding effectiveness. We show that it is possible to ensure that the shield is a lifetime component, the vacuum vessel is reweldable, and the magnets are adequately shielded. We conclude that molten salt blankets can be designed for fusion power plants with neutronics requirements such as adequate tritium breeding and shielding being satisfied.},

	abstract = {Data for 40 of the 71 isotopes/elements in FENDL-2.1 were taken from ENDF/B-VI.8. Following the release of ENDF/B-VII.0 we performed a preliminary assessment for changes made in data of these 40 isotopes/elements. We compared the relevant cross sections in the two libraries. In addition, we carried out MCNP calculations for a calculational benchmark representative of an early ITER design that was utilized during the FENDL development process. In addition, we performed 3-D calculations for an inertial fusion power plant conceptual design. It is concluded that modifying FENDL-2.1 to include the most recent ENDF/B-VII.0 is not urgently needed for ITER analysis. On the other hand, the larger changes in calculated ICF target neutronics parameters and tritium breeding ratio confirm the need for updating FENDL-2.1 for use in analysis of fusion systems beyond ITER. Additional calculations are in progress for integral experimental benchmarks to fully understand the impact of data changes introduced in ENDF/B-VII.0.},

The structural materials considered are ferritic steel, austenitic steel, vanadium alloy and SiC/SiC composite. Plasma facing materials included beryllium, tungsten, and carbon fiber composites. Atomic displacement damage and gas production rates are greatly influenced by the neutron energy spectrum. For the same neutron wall loading, atomic displacement damage is slightly lower in inertial fusion systems than in magnetic fusion systems but gas production is about a factor of 2 lower. In addition, much lower gas production is obtained in samples irradiated in fission reactors. The results help guide irradiation experiments in fission reactors to properly simulate the damage environment in fusion systems and facilitate extrapolating to the expected material performance in fusion systems.},

	abstract = {A set of improved geometric capabilities are developed for the Direct Accelerated Geometry for Monte Carlo (DAGMC) library to increase its ease of use and accuracy. The improvements are watertight faceting, robust particle tracking, automatic creation of nonsolid space, and overlap tolerance. Before being sealed, adjacent faceted surfaces do not have the same discretization along shared curves. Sealing together surfaces to create a watertight faceting prevents leakage of particles between surfaces. The tracking algorithm is made robust by ensuring numerical consistency and avoiding geometric tolerances. Monte Carlo simulation requires all space to be defined, whether it be vacuum, air, coolant, or a solid material. The implicit creation of nonsolid space reduces human effort otherwise required to explicitly create nonsolid space in a CAD program. CAD models often contain small gaps and overlaps between adjacent volumes due to imprecise modeling, file translation, or intentional deformation. Although gaps are filled by the implicit creation of nonsolid space, overlaps cause geometric queries to become unreliable. The particle tracking algorithm and point inclusion test are modified to tolerate small overlaps of adjacent volumes. Overlap-tolerant particle tracking eliminates manual repair of CAD models and enables analysis of meshed finite element models undergoing structural deformation. These improvements are implemented in a coupling of DAGMC with the Monte Carlo N-Particle (MCNP) code, known as DAG-MCNP. The elimination of both manual CAD repair and lost particles are demonstrated with CAD models used in production calculations.},

	abstract = {As both Monte Carlo radiation transport codes and 3D CAD modeling become more widely used, there has been an increasing number of efforts to combine these tools. One such effort is the Direct Accelerated Geometry Monte Carlo (DAGMC) software package being developed at the University of Wisconsin-Madison . DAGMC performs the particle tracking needed for
Monte Carlo radiation transport code directly on CAD geometries. DAGMC has been in development for a number of years and is in need of validation and verification in order to build user confidence in DAGMC's reliability and accuracy.

This work performs extensive testing of DAGMC implemented with the radiation transport code Monte Carlo N-Particle 5 (DAG-MCNP5). Four tests suites have been compiled for DAG-MCNP5 to ensure the accuracy of the code now and for future developers. These test suites are based largely on the test suites for MCNP5 and include: a suite of 80 regression tests, a suite of 75 verification tests, a suite of 30 validation criticality tests, and a suite of 19 validation shielding tests. These tests encompass a wide range of geometries, materials, and physics to test almost all of the features of DAG-MCNP5. The results of these test were compared to both analytical and experimental results, where appropriate, and MCNP5 results. A faceting tolerance study
was also performed for many of these test. It was found that a faceting tolerance of not large than 10-4 cm produces statistically similar results to MCNP5 on a consistent basis for all problem types. It is concluded that DAG-MCNP5 performs as accurately as MCNP5 for these test problems, and that DAG-MCNP5 can be considered a reliable neutronics code.},

	abstract = {The Advanced Power Extraction (APEX) program1 is exploring concepts for blanket designs that can enhance the potential of fusion while using both liquid and solid walls. In that context, an innovative blanket design of dry solid wall configuration, with potential for high neutron wall loading has been proposed. The blanket utilizes nanocomposited ferritic (NCF) steel structure (designated 12YWT), which has a maximum operating temperature of 800°C. The cooling/breeding material is Flibe (Li2BeF4), a low viscosity version of this molten salt, which has a melting temperature of 465°C and is compatible with ferritic steels up to 700°C2. The dimensions for this study have been taken from ARIES-AT3. The blanket module, which extends 0.3 m in the toroidal direction at mid-plane, is equipped with spiraling discs ramping from the bottom to the top. The coolant enters on the bottom at 500°C, then travels on the spiral discs, from the rear of the module to the front, then back to the rear, all the way to the top where it exits from the module at 590°C. On its way up, the coolant velocity is amplified at the first wall (FW) by centrifugal action, providing a high heat transfer coefficient for dissipating the high surface heating. The 3 mm thick FW is scalloped with semicircular projections inclined in the flow direction. This facilitates unimpeded smooth flow at the FW, while at the same time stiffening the FW against pressure, obviating the need for welded reinforcements. The discs are made of two halves assembled together with a Be pebble bed enclosed as a neutron multiplier. Preliminary neutronics analysis for the outboard blanket has shown a local tritium breeding ratio (TBR) of 1.36, and an energy multiplication (M) of 1.26 including contribution from a secondary module, using natural Li. The pressure drop of 0.56 MPa in the module produces a modified primary bending stress of 124 MPa where the allowable stress for this material at 750°C is 142 MPa. Without optimization, this blanket is capable of dissipating an average neutron wall loading of 6.4 MW/m2, with a peak value of 9.6 MW/m2 and a peak surface heating of 1.3 MW/m2. The coolant picks up energy in the secondary blanket exiting the reactor at 600°C. Assuming the use of a supercritical steam power cycle, an efficiency of 48\% can be expected.},

Several methods for fabricating the complex geometry of the first wall (FW) and blanket are presented. Preliminary coolant routing is proposed with solutions offered for minimizing heat losses and simplifying assembly and maintenance.

	annote = {Geometry modeling has recently emerged as a commodity capability. Several geometry modeling engines are available which provide largely the same capability, and most high-end CAD systems provide access to their geometry through APIs. However, subtle differences exist between these modelers, both at the syntax level and in the underlying topological models. A modeler-independent interface to geometry bridges these differences, allowing applications to be developed in a true modeler- independent manner. The Common Geometry Module, or CGM, provides such an interface to geometry. At the most basic level, CGM translates geometry function calls to access geometry in its native format. To smooth over topological differences between modelers, and to allow modeler-independent modification of topology, CGM maintains it own topology datastructure. CGM also provides functionality not found in most modelers, like support for non-manifold topology, and alternative representations, including facet-based and 'virtual' geometry. CGM is designed to be extensible, allowing applications to derive application-specific capabilities from topological entities defined in CGM. The CUBIT Mesh Generation Toolkit has been modified to work directly with CGM. CGM is also designed to simplify the implementation of other solid model-based or alternative representations of geometry. Ports to Solid Works and Pro/Engineer are underway. CGM is also being used as the foundation for parallel mesh generation, and is being used for geometry support in several advanced finite element analysis codes.}

By employing a number of acceleration techniques, the ray-tracing operations that are fundamental to Monte Carlo radiation transport are implemented efficiently for direct use on the CAD-based solid model, eliminating the need to translate to the native Monte Carlo input language. By forming hierarchical trees of oriented bounding boxes, one for each facet that results from a high-fidelity tessellation of the model, the ray-tracing performance is adequate to permit detailed analysis of large complex systems. In addition to the reduction in human effort and improvement in quality assurance that is found in the translation approaches, the DAGMC approach also permits the analysis of geometries with higher order surfaces that cannot be represented by many native Monte Carlo radiation transport tools.

	abstract = {Under the US Fusion Nuclear Science and Technology program, we selected the Dual Coolant Lead Lithium (DCLL) concept as our primary Test Blanket Module (TBM) for testing in ITER. The DCLL blanket concept has the potential to be a high-performance DEMO blanket design with a projected thermal efficiency of {\textgreater}40\%. Reduced activation ferritic/martensitic (RAF/M) steel is used as the structural material. Helium is used to cool the first wall and blanket structure, and the self-cooled Pb-17Li breeder is circulated for power conversion and for tritium extraction. A SiC-based flow channel insert (FCI) is used as an electrical insulator for magnetohydrodynamic pressure drop reduction from the circulating Pb-17Li and as a thermal insulator to separate the high-temperature Pb-17Li (∼650–700°C) from the RAF/M structure, which has a corrosion temperature limit of ∼480°C. The RAF/M material must also operate at temperatures above 350°C but less than 550°C. We are continuing the development of the mechanical design and performing neutronics, structural and thermal hydraulics analyses of the DCLL TBM module. Prototypical FCI structures were fabricated and further attention was paid to MHD effects and the design of the inboard blanket for DEMO. We are also making progress on related R\&D needs to address key areas. This paper is a summary report on the progress and results of recent DCLL TBM development activities.},

Both self-cooled and dual coolant molten salt options were evaluated. We have also included the dual coolant leadeutectic Pb-17Li design in our assessment. We take advantage of the molten salt low electrical and thermal conductivity to minimize impacts from the MHD effect and the heat losses from the breeder to the actively cooled steel structure. For the Pb-17Li breeder we employ flow channel inserts of SiCf/SiC composite with low electrical and thermal conductivity to perform respective insulation functions. We performed preliminary assessments of these design options in the areas of neutronics, thermal-hydraulics, safety, and power conversion system.

Such a tool should be able to interpret phenomena from mutually dependent scientific disciplines and predict performance with sufficient accuracy and consistency. Integrated multi-physics simulation predictive capability (ISPC) relies upon advanced numerical simulation techniques and is being applied to ITER first wall/shield and Test Blanket Module (TBM) designs. In this paper, progress in ISPC development is described through the presentation of a number of integrated simulations. The simulations cover key physical phenomena encountered in a fusion plasma chamber system, including tritium permeation, fluid dynamics, and structure mechanics. Interface engines were developed in order to pass field data, such as surface deformation or nuclear heating rate, from the structural analysis to the thermo-fluid MHD analysis code for magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) velocity profile assessments, or from the neutronics analysis to the thermo-fluid analysis for temperature calculations, respectively. Near-term effort toward further ISPC development is discussed.},

	abstract = {Because of its low melting temperature (240°C) and low vapor pressure, the molten salt LiF–NaF–BeF2 (Flinabe) with ratio 1:1:1 has been suggested as the front flowing liquid layer, FFLL (2-cm thick) in the Convective Liquid Flow First Wall (CLiFF) high power density concept (7 MW/m2 average neutron wall load, 10 MW/m2 max.). However, because of its lower Li concentration relative to LiF–BeF2 (Flibe, with ratio 2:1), its deployment as a breeder has been a concern. In this paper, we compare the local tritium breeding ratio (TBR) of Flinabe to Flibe in two arrangements: (1) as a FFLL and breeder in the blanket; and (2) as only the FFLL with LiPb/SiC conventional blanket following the FW. The impact of the choice of ferritic steel (FS) and SiC as the structural material on TBR was also examined. In addition, the paper discusses what constitutes a reasonable value for local TBR if all sources of uncertainties in the achievable and the required TBR are considered (e.g. modeling, nuclear data, burn up rate in the plasma, etc.)},

	abstract = {The US is proposing two “look-alike” sub-modules, based on helium-cooled pebble bed (HCPB) ceramic breeder, to be tested in the same test blanket module (TBM) that will occupy a quarter of a port in ITER and placed next to the Japanese TBM. The TBM has a toroidal width of 73cm, a radial depth of 60cm and a poloidal height of 91cm. The ceramic breeder is made of Li4SiO4 with 75\% Li-6 enrichment (60\% packing factor) and beryllium is used as the multiplier. The two sub-modules are arranged in two configurations, namely a layered configuration and an edge-on configuration. In the present work, we analyze these two sub-modules using two-dimensional discrete ordinates transport codes in R-θ model that accounts for the presence of the ITER shielding blanket and the surrounding frame of the port. The objectives are: (1) to examine the profiles of heating and tritium production rates in the two sub-modules, both in the radial and toroidal direction, in order to identify locations where neutronics measurements can be best performed with least perturbation from the surroundings, (2) to provide both local and integrated values for nuclear heating rates required for subsequent thermo-mechanics analysis, and (3) to compare the tritium production capabilities of two variants for the HCPB blanket concept, mainly the parallel and the edge-on configurations. We present the main findings from this study in this paper.},

	abstract = {The thin Convective Liquid Flow First Wall (CLiFF) concept is one of the liquid FW concepts investigated in the Advanced Power Extraction (APEX) study for high power density application. Liquid tin has been suggested as the 2 cm thick front flowing liquid layer because of its low vapor pressure. Two choices were selected for the conventional blanket that follows the thin liquid wall (LW), namely: (1) LiPb/SiC blanket, and (2) Flibe/SiC blanket. Lithium is enriched to 90\% Li-6 in the first blanket option and to 25\% Li-6 in the second option (with 10 cm-thick beryllium front zone). Due to the superior attenuation characteristics of Flibe over LiPb, this impacted the lifetime of the SiC structure used in both options. In this paper, we assessed the lifetime of the SiC structure in the FW/Blanket and the shield in both blanket options. The end-of-life limit of 200 dpa is assumed (corresponding to ∼3\% burn-up). The frequency of replacement of each component is estimated based on 30-years plant lifetime. Comparison is made for the waste volume of replaced components in each option. It is shown that the shield can last the plant lifetime in the Flibe blanket while part of the shield in the LiPb blanket will require replacement. The frequency of replacing the FW/Blanket with the LiPb blanket option is twice as much as in the Flibe blanket option. This is translated to a total volume of disposed structure at plant end-of-life from the entire FW/B/shield system that is larger by ∼60\%.},

	abstract = {Among the advantages offered by the deployment of thick liquid walls (LW) in high power density reactors is the substantial reduction in radwaste volume and hazard that is mainly attributed to the extended lifetime of structural materials. In this paper, we quantitatively estimate the volume of the generated waste when different thick LWs are used. In particular, we make a comparison of the radwaste volume between lithium and Flibe as potential candidates for deployment as the thick LWs in high power density reactors (10 MW/m2). In addition, the volume of the generated waste is compared with the corresponding volume in two conventional solid wall (SW) blankets with low wall load (LWL, 5 MW/m2) and high wall load (HWL, 10 MW/m2). In this assessment exercise, the blankets under consideration were optimized first such that adequate tritium breeding ratio (TBR) is obtained and the same level of magnet protection against radiation damage is reached. This initial optimization step was necessary to arrive at consistent comparisons. It is shown that using LWL conventional SW blanket generates ∼10\% more waste volume per unit height than that generated with the lithium LW concept while ∼35\% more waste volume is generated if the HWL conventional SW blanket is deployed. On the other hand, it is shown that the thick Li LW option generates total waste whose volume is a factor of ∼1.3 larger than the one with the thick Flibe option which has superior neutron moderating capabilities compared with lithium.},

	abstract = {The US has considered, among other options, two blanket concepts for Demo reactor in which helium is primarily used to cool the first wall (FW) and structure whereas molten salt (MS) is used as both coolant and breeder. Conventional reduced activation ferritic steel (RAFS, F82H) is used as the structural material in both blanket concepts. The low melting point Flibe ( 380°C) is used in the first option while the Flinabe ( 305°C) is used in the second option. In this paper, we present the results for assessing the radioactivity and decay heat. This assessment is performed separately for the structural material, the Be multiplier and the breeder (Flibe/Flinabe). The Class C waste disposal rating (WDR) was estimated for each material. For Flibe, Flinabe and Be the WDR is much lower than unity. However, the WDR for F82H is 0.6-1.3. They are attributed to reactions with Mo and Nb present in F82H with levels of 70 wppm and 4 wppm, respectively. To ensure that F82H qualifies for shallow land burial, it is suggested to reduce these two impurities to 50 and 3 wppm, respectively.},

	abstract = {Neutronics testing is among the several types of fusion technology testing scheduled to be performed in ITER. The three ports assigned for testing will test several blanket concepts proposed by the various parties with test blanket modules (TBM) that utilize different breeders and coolants. Nevertheless, neutronics issues to be resolved in ITER-TBM are generic in nature and are important to each TBM type. Dedicated neutronics tests specifically address the accuracy involved in predicting key neutronics parameters such as tritium production rate, TPR, volumetric heating rate, induced activation and decay heat, and radiation damage to the reactor components. In this paper, we address some strategies for performing the neutronics tests. Tritium self-sufficiency cannot be confirmed by testing in ITER, however, the testing can provide valuable information regarding the main parameters needed to assess the feasibility of achieving tritium self-sufficiency. The paper also addresses the operational requirement (i.e. flux and fluence) as well as the geometrical requirement of the test module (i.e. minimum size) in order to have meaningful and useful tests. Measured neutronics data require high spatial resolution. This necessitates that the measured quantity be as flat as possible in the innermost locations inside the test module. This requirement has been confirmed in the present work based on results from two-dimensional calculations. The US and Japan solid breeder test blanket modules are placed inside half a port in ITER. The R-θ model used accounts for the presence of the ITER shielding blanket and the surrounding frame of the port.},

Conventional ferritic steel (F82H) is used as the structure of the first wall (FW), the two breeder channels, the back plate, the inlet/out piping, and the shield plug. Two separate cooling circuits are employed: helium is used to cool the FW and blanket structure while the Pb-17Li is used as a coolant and breeder mainly in the two breeder channels. SiC flow channel inserts (FCI) are used to thermally and electrically isolate the flowing Pb-17Li from the relatively low-temperature structure. A 2 mm thick beryllium layer is used as a plasma facing material on the FW area (1.25 m2 ) subjected to 0.78 MW/m2 neutron wall load.
